# If this fails with a ref error. it could be that the remote gh-pages was
# deleted. I don't know how this happens or why this breaks things, but a work
# around is to re-create the remote gh-pages with *any* commit then re run this
# script. e.g.:
#
#    git push origin master:gh-pages && blog/bin/publish
#    bin/publish
git push origin `git subtree split --prefix blog`:gh-pages --force
