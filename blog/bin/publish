# If this fails with a ref error. it could be that the remote gh-pages was
# deleted. I dont' know why this breaks things, but a work around is to re-create
# the remote gh-pages with *any* commit then re run this script. e.g. 
# git push origin master:gh-pages && blog/bin/publish
set -x
git push origin `git subtree split --prefix blog`:gh-pages --force
