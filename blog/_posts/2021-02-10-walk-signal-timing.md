summary: How does walk signal timing affect simulated trips in Seattle?
---

Seattle has recently made changes to how long they think pedestrians should
have to wait before they get a "Walk" signal.

This simulation shows a map of Rainier Beach in Seattle.

<div id="simulation">
</div>

<style type="text/css"> 
#simulation {
  height: 400px;
}
</style>

<!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/simulation.js"></script> -->
<script type="module">
  import { Simulation } from "/js/simulation.js";

  // TODO: pass in wasm URL
  let el = document.getElementById("simulation");
  let simulation = new Simulation(el);

  $(document).ready(async function() {
      await simulation.loadAndStart();
  });
</script>

That's all!
