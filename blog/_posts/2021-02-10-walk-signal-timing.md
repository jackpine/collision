summary: How does walk signal timing affect simulated trips in Seattle?
---

Seattle has recently made changes to how long they think pedestrians should
have to wait before they get a "Walk" signal.

This simulation shows a map of Rainier Beach in Seattle.

<div id="widgetry-demo-root">
</div>

<style type="text/css"> 
#widgetry-demo-root {
  height: 400px;
}
</style>

<script type="module">
  import { WidgetryDemo } from "/js/widgetry_demo.js";
  let widgetry_demo_app = new WidgetryDemo("widgetry-demo-root");
  $(document).ready(async function() {
      await widgetry_demo_app.loadAndStart();
  });
</script>

That's all!
