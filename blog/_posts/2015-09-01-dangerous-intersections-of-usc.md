summary: USC has 4 of the 5 most dangerous intersections for cyclists in Los Angeles.
title: Why Does USC Have So Many Dangerous Intersections?
---

Our original goal was to write an article about the dangerous
intersections across the entire city of Los Angeles. We ranked
intersections by the number of cyclist injuries reported in our
collision [dataset](#dataset), spanning 2002-2012. But there were so
many patterns and so much data that any conclusions drawn would be very
high level and not very useful. Instead we've decided to publish a
series of more specific articles on the topic. Each article will dive
into a particular neighborhood or focus on a single pattern emerging
from our analysis. When we refer to the worst or most dangerous
intersections, we are referring to intersections that have the highest
numbers of reported incidents resulting in cyclist injuries or deaths.

By this metric, four of the five most dangerous intersections in all of
Los Angeles are at USC. While the Universityâ€™s large cycling population
likely contributes greatly to the high frequency of collisions, the
sheer number of injured cyclists makes this an area well worth studying
when discussing new legislation and infrastructure, regardless of the
per capita injury rate. In the rest of this article we go into more
detail about where specifically these injuries are happening and why
they might be occurring.

## Dataset <a name='dataset'></a>

This analysis is based on data pulled from the
[TIMS](http://tims.berkeley.edu/) project out of Berkeley which in turn gets
data from the California Highway Patrol
[SWITRS](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) database.  It
encompasses collisions reported to law enforcement between 2002-2012. The
actual number of incidents may be worse where collisions go unreported.

This data is somewhat old. With cycling on the rise, the number of
people affected and potentially at risk for injury or death while
cycling in the city is certainly growing. Take a look at our [heatmap of
bicycle collisions in California](/blog/2015/07/14/collision-heatmap) to get
a visual idea of how bicycle collisions are growing in different areas
over time.

data by reading our [how-to article](/blog/2015/08/13/dangerous-intersections-how-to).

### The Worst

The worst single intersection near USC can be found at Jefferson & Vermont,
where 14 cyclists were injured during the data collection period.

Considering the high automobile traffic, proximity to USC (lots of cyclists),
and complete lack of bicycle infrastructure, it's not surprising that so many
injuries happen here.

### Hoover, the Real Worst

Hoover at 28th, 29th, and 30th all have a very high number of injured cyclists.
Respectively there were 12, 13, and 12 injuries reported at each of these
intersections. That's 37 cyclists injured by cars in just a few blocks.

What's going on here that so many cyclists are being injured? Of course
part of it is due to the high volume of cyclists on Hoover. Hoover is a
major collector street, funneling everybody from the north side of
campus. Is there anything in the environment we've built contributing to
this? Let's take a look.

  <img class='fullscreen-article-image'
       alt='Google Street View of 28th and Hoover, a dog-legged intersection and two cyclists riding across a crosswalk'
       src='/media/West on 28th at Hoover.jpg' />
  <div class='article-caption'>

    crosswalk on the left, turning south onto the Hoover bike lane.

Hoover has had a bike lane since at least 2007. 28th crosses Hoover as
a disjointed dog-leg intersection. Here's the view from the other side.

  <div class='article-caption'>
    On 28th, looking east onto Hoover, we see lots of traffic and a <a href="http://www.streetsblog.net/2010/04/19/the-persistence-of-bike-salmon/">bike salmon</a> going the wrong way in a bike lane. With five lanes of traffic, Hoover doesn't look like a very easy street to cross safely.
    <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0293472,-118.2841343,3a,75y,91.01h,78.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slIGp3zoZ_tkuvSSadk8GPw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1'

29th terminates into Hoover at a T-intersection. 30th is a regular four-way
intersection. However, there is a bend in the roadway just east of Hoover on
30th.

### Observations

In looking at these intersections, I'm struck by two things.

The first is the unsafe cyclist behavior.  To be clear, when looking
through Google Street View, we did seek out images with cyclists, but we
didn't *specifically* seek out cyclists acting unsafely, apparently it's
just that common. For example, take another look at that last 
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0277429,-118.2839797,3a,15y,5.69h,84.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sc5H44ZS5_gclUekHUgVJZg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656'
   target='_blank'>
  street view of 29th and Hoover</a>,
where the cyclist runs the red light to turn left across traffic.  Pan right
and what do you see?

We're definitely *not* here to blame the victims in cases where riding
behavior could have prevented an injury. For one, we don't believe that bikes
should always ride like cars drive. But this article isn't about "ethically
correct cycling behavior." For that you can read any number of angry cyclist
forum threads. Regardless of what is "correct," we want cycling to be safer,
and just telling people to "be more careful" is not a very
effective strategy. *Ridazz gonna ride.*

Luckily, we know that behavior and the built environment are
inextricably linked, which brings us to our second observation. For as
many cyclists as there are riding around USC, there is a severe lack of
cycling infrastructure. Currently there is only an unprotected bike lane
on Hoover and some sharrows painted on 28th and 29th. We can do better.
As one of the most cycling dense neighborhoods in Los Angeles, USC
presents the perfect opportunity for investing in better infrastructure
to protect cyclists and promote safer riding behavior.

Hoover's bike lane should be separated or at least buffered. 28th and
29th should be striped to make visible where cyclists will be funneling
into Hoover.  Maybe the light at 29th & Hoover should be shorter.
Converting the intersections at 28th, 29th, and 30th to roundabouts
could promote safer traffic mixing and lower speeds in intersections.
Hoover terminates into Jefferson just one block south of 30th anyway -
automobiles don't need to be traveling fast here. There is a smorgasbord
of design options to make cycling safer near USC.

## Stepping Back

When we began our analysis looking across all of LA, it became clear
that there were intersections with inordinately high number of cyclist
injuries. This is sometimes due to a higher volume of cyclists and
sometimes a lack of adequate cycling infrastructure in these
neighborhoods.

In particular USC and the Vermont corridor are ripe for safer mobility
infrastructure like bike lanes and traffic calming. But beyond these clusters,
most of the dangerous intersections in Los Angeles are scattered. From Santa
Monica to Boyle Heights, from Canoga Park to the Port, it's clear that better
comprehensive planning and engineering is required across the city.

</div>

This is not to say that there arenâ€™t patterns that deserve priority in
treatment. Similar to the recent [LA Times Analysis of Dangerous Pedestrian
Intersections](http://graphics.latimes.com/la-pedestrians/), we found that 25%
of cyclist injuries occurred at 1% of the intersections in Los Angeles. These
intersections are prime candidates for improvement in line with Los Angeles's
[recently approved mobility
element](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-mobility-plan-los-angeles-20150811-story.html)
which lays out some new standards and strategies for how the city plans and
builds its transportation systems to facilitate *all* modes of travel, not just
automobiles. In particular, Garcetti's [vision
zero](http://la.streetsblog.org/2014/09/30/ladots-bold-new-strategic-vision-eliminate-l-a-traffic-deaths-by-2025/)
component declares that each traffic death must be viewed as a failure,
necessitating changes in infrastructure and/or policy, with a goal of reducing
traffic fatalities to zero by 2035.

### What Next?

We hope you found this analysis interesting, and maybe even useful. If you are
interested in looking into our methods, check out our [how-to
article](/blog/2015/08/13/dangerous-intersections-how-to).  It's not hard to
get started, and we're excited to share and learn with other folks who
want to use data to help draw conclusions about the world around us.

We will continue to research and talk about cycling safety in Los Angeles, not
only from behind our computer screens with statistical/geospatial analysis, but
also from our bikes. We personally experience the physical environmental
factors on the street that make some of these routes so dangerous, while other
routes offer a safe, economical, and fun way to get around.
