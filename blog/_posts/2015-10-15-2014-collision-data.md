summary: We're providing Los Angeles collision data through 2014, but where does this data come from, and how do you use it?

Here are our updated shapefiles for collisions in Los Angeles through
2014.

The source data for these shapefiles came from
[@RoadSafeGIS](https://twitter.com/RoadSafeGIS) who generously compiled
the most recently available [SWITRS data for the city of Los
Angeles](http://www.roadsafegis.com/blog/city-of-los-angeles-geocoded-switrs-data-free-download/)
into Esri's FileGDB format. Thanks to
[@VisionZeroLA](https://twitter.com/VisionZeroLA) for pointing us to
it!

## Processing

We transfored the data using a one step script we [wrote and published on
github](https://github.com/jackpine/collision/blob/master/data/SWITRS_ROADSAFE/bin/process).
That script will show you *exactly* what we did to the data.

Using that script we transformed the RoadSafe data into shapefiles. As
well as being larger and slower than Esri FileGDB, shapefiles are a
legacy format that boast a 10 character limit on your attribute column
names.  For example 'BICYCLE_ACCIDENT' is truncated to the impenetrable
'BICYCLE_AC'. Rather than invent our own short names, we used the
headers from the [TIMS project](http://tims.berkeley.edu/).

So why would we choose to use this terribly crusty out-of-date format?
Well, for one, FileGDB is 10 times slower while using,
[QGIS](https://qgis.org) (my desktop GIS of choice). I suspect, but
cannot confirm, that if you are using ESRI ArcGIS that there would be no
upside to using these shapefiles over the ESRI FileGDB format, and you'd
best use the upstream data sources straight from [RoadSafe
GIS](http://www.roadsafegis.com/blog/city-of-los-angeles-geocoded-switrs-data-free-download/).

We also projected the dataset to EPSG:2229 (California Zone 5), a common
projection for Southern California which allows us to easily interact
with the data using US feet instead of degrees.

have any questions about this data.
