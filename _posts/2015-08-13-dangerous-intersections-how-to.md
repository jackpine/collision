title: How to Find LA's Most Dangerous Intersections
summary: A step-by-step guide for how we ranked Los Angeles's most dangerous intersections for cyclists using publicly available data.
---

We set out to find the most dangerous intersections for cyclists in Los
Angeles. We used this analysis to write our article on [dangerous intersections
of USC](/blog/2015/09/01/dangerous-intersections-of-usc/).

Process

### Intersections

Using QGIS, we turned the [circulation file](#data-sources), which is
essentially a bunch of lines, into a bunch of intersections (points).
(Menu:Vector > Analysis > Line Intersections). You want to intersect the
circulation layer with itself, leaving the OBJECTID as the unique identifier.

  <div class='article-caption'>
    This will take a while.
  </div>
</div>

These are pretty large data sets, so some of the operations can be
really slow. To speed things up while we perfected our process, we
cropped out everything except a small neighborhood within LA. Once we
had our process down, we ran through it again on the entire data set.

Now, because our newly created intersections are points, we need to calculate a
small buffer that represents the "area" of the intersection around each point.
To simplify analysis, we assume that all collisions within 30 feet of the
intersection should be considered.

We arrived at this number (30ft) empirically by comparing the number of
accidents at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 foot buffers around the intersection. Our
data showed a sharp leveling off after 30 feet.

Create a new buffer (Menu: Vector > GeoProcessing Tools > Buffer).
Select your new intersections layer as the input vector layer, and set
buffer distance to 30. Save your output shapefile as "intersection
buffers".

### Collisions

Starting with [SWITRS](#data-sources), which contains all collisions, we want
to get just those collisions where a cyclist was injured. Add the
`Collisions03to12.shp` as a new vector layer. Right click on the layer to open
the attributes table. Filter the records in the attributes table. Filter the
records where `'BICCOL' = 'Y'`.

  <img class='fullscreen-article-image'
       alt='Screenshot of QGIS attributes table filtering "BICCOL = Y"'
       src='/media/QGIS - filter for bicycle collisions.jpg' />
  <div class='article-caption'>
    This will also take a while.
  </div>
</div>

After applying the filter, our attribute table has only *bicycle* collisions.
Select all the rows (ctrl + a or cmd + a on mac).  Then press the "copy
selected rows" button. Back in the main QGIS window we paste the features as
new vector layer (Menu: Edit > Paste Features as > New Vector Layer). Call the
new layer "bicycle collisions".

### Combining the Two

Now, we want to count all the collisions that occurred within each one of these
buffers. We can do this using the QGIS Points in Polygon feature,
(Menu: Vector > Analysis > Points in Polygon). Input polygon vector layer
should be the intersection buffer and the Input point vector layer should be
the bicycle collisions layer.

<div>
  <img class='fullscreen-article-image'
       alt='Screenshot of QGIS Count Points in Polygon dialog'
       src='/media/QGIS - collisions per intersection.jpg' />
  <div class='article-caption'>
    This will also take a while.
  </div>
</div>

Select the `BICINJ` and `BICKILL` columns to aggregate the number of injured
and killed cyclist per intersection. Make sure you're using `sum` to aggregate
your columns and rename the output count filed to `COLCNT`. Call your output
shapefile "bicycle collisions per intersection" and save.

Inspect the attributes table of that new layer, sort by count, and *viola*.

If you had any questions, or comments lease let us know so we can improve this
article. Also, we'd love to help you get involved in doing analysis with this
data yourself.
