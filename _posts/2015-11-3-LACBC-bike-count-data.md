The [Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition](http://la-bike.org) just
finished their 2015 bicycle count. As usual they have published their
data via UCLA's [Bicycle Data
Clearinghouse](http://www.bikecounts.luskin.ucla.edu). You can find the new 2015 counts there.

    Total bike counts over time, in 15 minute intervals. This includes
    all data sets from the last few years from the [Bicycle Data
    Clearinghouse](http://www.bikecounts.luskin.ucla.edu).  Download the
    <a href="#bike-count-shapefiles">full dataset</a> below. White dots
    represent no bicycles seen in the 15 minute interval.

<script>
  $(function(){
    var application = new BikeCountMap($("#map"));
  });
</script>

Unfortunately the clearinghouse does not offer shapefiles, only csv's,
which separate the location data from the count data. A little bit of
[processing](#processing) to the rescue!

### Bike Count Shapefiles

   * Pre-2013 bicycle counts in Los Angeles and the
   surrounding area.

   * 2013 and after bicycle counts. This data has more fields than the
   earlier counts, including if the cyclist appeared to be a woman, the
   road surface type, and whether the cyclist was wearing a helmet.

     * Count numbers and location id in Los Angeles and the
     surrounding area after and including 2013. This data has more fields,
     including if the cyclist appeared to be a woman, the road surface
     type, and whether the cyclist was wearing a helmet.
   * [<i class="fa fa-file"></i> locations.csv](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/collision-la/data/2015-11-3-LACBC-bike-count-data/locations.csv)
     * Translates location id to actual latitude/longitude and other location data, to be joined with the
     interval data.

## Processing

Conceptually, we just needed to join the count intervals (which
represent a chunk of time when people were counting bikes at a
particluar location) with the latitude/longitude of their count
location.
