summary: USC has 4 of Los Angeles's 5 Most Dangerous Intersections for Cyclists.
title: Why Does USC Have So Many Dangerous Intersections?
---

Our original goal was to write an article about the dangerous intersections
across the entire city of Los Angeles. Specifically, we rankeded
intersections by the number of cyclists reported injured in our
[SWITRS](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) based collision
[dataset](#dataset), spanning 2002-2013. But there was so much data, and so
many patterns that any conclusions drawn here would be very high level and not
very useful. Instead we've decided to publish a series of more specific
articles on the topic. We'll be diving into particular neighborhoods or
focusing on a single pattern emerging from our analysis.

One of the most striking patterns we found was near USC. Four of the five most
dangerous intersections in all of Los Angeles are at USC. In the rest of this
article we go into more detail about where specifically this is happening and
why this might be.

So, why are there so many injured cyclists near USC? The biggest contributor to
their high incident count is no doubt the high number of cyclists in this area.
We aren't necessarily saying that they have more collisions per capita. Still,
each of these represents and injured person, and multiple deaths. It is
certainly worthy of our consideration when discussing new legislation and
infrastructure.

### The Worst

The worst single intersection near USC can be found at Jefferson
& Vermont. 14 cyclists were injured here.

Considering the high automobile traffic, proximity to USC (lots of cyclists),
and complete lack of bicycle infrastructure, it's not surprising that so many
injuries happened here.

### Hoover, the Real Worst

Hoover at 28th, 29th, and 30th all have a very high number of injured cyclists.
Respectively there were 12, 13, and 12 injuries reported at *each* of these
intersections.  That's 37 cyclists, struck by cars in just a few blocks.

What's going on here that so many are being injured? Of course part of it is
due to the high volume of cyclists on Hoover. Hoover is a major collector
street, funneling in everybody from the North side of campus. Is there anything
in the built environment contributing to this? Let's take a look.

Hoover actually has had a bike lane since at least 2007. 28th crosses Hoover as
a disjointed dogleg intersection. Here's the other side.

  <div class='article-caption'>
    On 28th, looking east onto Hoover we see lots of traffic and a
    <a href="http://www.streetsblog.net/2010/04/19/the-persistence-of-bike-salmon/">bike salmon</a>
    going the wrong way in a bike lane. Five lanes with traffic, Hoover doesn't
    look like a very easy street to cross safely.

29th terminates into Hoover as a T-intersection. 30th is a regular four-way
intersection. However, there is a bend in the roadway just east of Hoover on
30th.

### A Note on Cyclist Behavior

In looking at some of these images, we can see that while there is definitely
some low hanging infrastructural fruit, unsafe cyclist behavior is also common.
To be clear, when looking through the Google Street View, we did seek out
images with cyclists, but we didn't specifically seek out cyclists acting
unsafely, apparently it's just common. For example, take another look at that
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0277429,-118.2839797,3a,15y,5.69h,84.24t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sc5H44ZS5_gclUekHUgVJZg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656'
   target='_blank'>
  last street view of 29th and Hoover
</a>,
where the cyclist runs the red light to turn left across traffic.  Pan right
and what do you see?

We're definitely *not* here to blame the victims in cases where safer riding
behavior could have prevented an injury. For one, we don't believe that bikes
should always ride like cars drive. But this article isn't about "ethically
correct cycling behavior." For that you can read any number of angry cyclist
forum threads. Regardless of what is "correct," we want cycling to be safer,
and just telling people to "be more careful" is not a very
effective strategy. Ridazz gonna ride. Luckily though, we know that behavior
and the built environment are inextricably linked. For example, though there is
a light at 29th & Hoover, maybe it's too long. Or what would happen if all
these intersections 28, 29, and 30 were replaced with roundabouts to promote
safer traffic mixing and lower speeds in intersections? Hoover terminates into
Jefferson just one block south of 30th anyway - automobiles don't need to be
traveling fast here. We *have* design options available to make cycling safer.

## Dataset <a name='dataset'></a>

This analysis is based on the data pulled from the [TIMS](http://tims.berkeley.edu/) project out of
Berkeley which in turn gets their data from the California Highway
Patrol [SWITRS](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) database. It encompasses collisions reported to law
enforcement between 2002-2012. Actual number of incidents may be worse where collisions go unreported.

This data is somewhat old. With cycling on the rise, the number of
people affected, and potentially at risk for injury or death while
cycling in the city is certainly growing. Take a look at our [heatmap of
bicycle collisions in California](/blog/2015/07/14/collision-heatmap) to get
a visual idea of how bicycle collisions are growing in different areas
over time.

You can read more about how we generated these figures and download all
our data by reading our [how-to article](/blog/2015/08/13/dangerous-intersections-how-to).

## What Next? 

When we began our analysis looking across all of LA, it was clear that there
were intersections with inordinately high number of cyclist injuries. This is
sometimes due to a higher volume of cyclists and sometimes a lack of adequate
cycling infrastructure in these neighborhoods.

In particular USC and the Vermont corridor are ripe for safer mobility
infrastructure like bike lanes and traffic calming. But beyond these
clusters, most of the dangerous intersections in Los Angeles are
scattered. From Santa Monica to Boyle Heights, from Canoga Park to the
Port, it's clear that better comprehensive planning and engineering is
required across the city.

This is not to say that there aren’t patterns that deserve priority in
treatment. Similar to the recent [LA Times Analysis of Dangerous Pedestrian
Intersections](http://graphics.latimes.com/la-pedestrians/), we found that 25%
of cyclist injuries occurred at 1% of the intersections in Los Angeles. These
intersections are prime candidates for improvement in line with Los Angeles's
[recently approved mobility
element](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-mobility-plan-los-angeles-20150811-story.html)
which lays out some new standards and strategies for how the city plans and
builds its transportation systems to facilitate *all* modes of travel, not
just automobiles. In particular, Garcetti's [vision
zero](http://la.streetsblog.org/2014/09/30/ladots-bold-new-strategic-vision-eliminate-l-a-traffic-deaths-by-2025/)
component declares that each traffic death must be viewed as a failure,
necessitating changes in infrastructure and/or policy, with a goal of reducing
traffic fatalities to zero by 2035.

We hope you found this analysis interesting, and maybe even useful. If you are
interested in looking into our methods, check out our [how-to article](/blog/2015/08/13/dangerous-intersections-how-to). It's
not hard to get started, and we're excited to share and learn with other folks
interested in using data to help draw conclusions of the world around us.

We will continue to research and talk about cycling safety in Los Angeles, not only
from behind our computer screens with statistical/geospatial analysis, but also
from our bikes. We experience the physical environmental factors on the street
that make some of these places so dangerous, while others are a safe,
economical, and fun way to get around.
