    The view I'm most familiar with. On 4th Stret, staring longingly east at Shatto Lanes, waiting for that slowwwwww light on Vermont to change.

With 16 recorded cyclist injuries, the number one most dangerous intersection
for cyclists in Los Angeles is 4th & Vermont, in Koreatown.

Vermont Avenue is definitely cause for concern. Vermont claims two of the ten
worst intersections in LA. Unsurprisingly, Vermont is a high traffic street
with no bicycle infrastructure.



This may point to the lack of strong North/South connector alternatives
for cyclists in Los Angeles. There are relatively more bike lanes on
some of the major east west streets like Santa Monica Blvd (in West
Hollywood and Westwood at least) and Sunset Blvd from Echo park to its
junction in East Hollywood. 4th and 7th streets across Koreatown also
boast bike lanes or at least sharrows. But where are our major
North/South bike lanes anyway?
