summary: Ranking Los Angeles's most dangerous intersections for cyclists.
---

We set out to find the most dangerous intersections for cyclists in
the city of Los Angeles. Specifically, we want to rank intersections by the
number of cyclists reported injured in our
[SWITRS](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) based collision
[dataset](#dataset), spanning 2002-2013.

At a high level, we found that though there were some concentrated areas
of especially dangerous intersections, significant hot spots are scattered
across the entire city.

The Worst Five
--------------

### Number Five

Hoover & 30th, near USC, comes in at the fifth most dangerous
intersection for cyclists in Los Angeles.  There were 12 injured
cyclists at this intersection recorded in our data set.

In fact, four of the worst five intersections for cyclist injuries
are near USC.  Part of this is no doubt related to the high number of cyclists
in this neighborhood, but it still speaks to the need for increased investment
in safe cycling infrastructure near USC.

### Tied for Number Three

Continuing the sad story of cycling near USC, 28th & Hoover and 29th &
Hoover were independently tied for the third most dangerous
intersection in LA. There were 13 recorded injuries in our
[dataset](#dataset) at *each* intersection. Also interesting is that
both of these are "T" intersections, with streets terminating into
Hoover. What's going on here that so many are being injured? From the data
it appears that at 28th & Hoover people have been hit *on* Hoover, while
on 29th & Hoover, people have been hit *on* 29th.

### Number Two

The number two most dangerous intersection for cyclists was Jefferson
& Vermont. 15 cyclists were injured here. This is the most dangerous
intersection near USC.

Considering the high automobile traffic, proximity to USC (lots of cyclists),
and complete lack of bicycle infrastructure, it's not surprising that so many
injuries happened here.

### The Worst Intersection in Los Angeles

With 16 recorded cyclist injuries, the number one most dangerous intersection
for cyclists in Los Angeles is 4th & Vermont, in Koreatown.

Vermont Avenue is definitely cause for concern. Vermont claims two of the ten
worst intersections in LA. Unsurprisingly, Vermont is a high traffic street
with no bicycle infrastructure.

This may point to the lack of strong North/South connector alternatives
for cyclists in Los Angeles. There are relatively more bike lanes on
some of the major east west streets like Santa Monica Blvd (in West
Hollywood and Westwood at least) and Sunset Blvd from Echo park to its
junction in East Hollywood. 4th and 7th streets across Koreatown also
boast bike lanes or at least sharrows. But where are our major
North/South bike lanes anyway?

## Dataset

This analysis is based on the data pulled from the [TIMS](http://tims.berkeley.edu/) project out of
Berkeley which in turn gets their data from the California Highway
Patrol [SWITRS](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) database. It encompasses collisions reported to law
enforcement between 2002-2012. Actual number of incidents may be worse where collisions go unreported.

This data is somewhat old. With cycling on the rise, the number of
people affected, and potentially at risk for injury or death while
cycling in the city is certainly growing. Take a look at our [heatmap of
bicycle collisions](http://collisions.jackpine.me) in Los Angeles to get
a visual idea of how bicycle collisions are growing in different areas
over time.

You can read more about how we generated these figures and download all
our data by reading our [how-to article]().

## Systematic Failure

When analysing the data, it's clear that there are intersections with
inordinately high number of cyclist injuries. This is likely due to both
a higher volume of cyclists and a lack of adequate cycling infrastructure in
these neighborhoods.

In particular USC and the Vermont corridor are ripe for safer mobility
infrastructure like bike lanes and traffic calming. But beyond these
clusters, most of the dangerous intersections in Los Angeles are
scattered. From Santa Monica to Boyle Heights, from Canoga Park to the
Port, it's clear that better comprehensive planning and engineering is
required across the city.

This is not to say that there aren’t more patterns that deserve priority in
treatment. In fact, we hope to write more about this, not only from behind our
computer screens with statistical/geospatial patterns, but also from our bikes,
experiencing on the street the physical environmental factors that make these
places so dangerous.

These are just the top 10 intersections. Together these 140 reported
cyclist injuries comprise a tiny fraction of the 27066 injured cyclists
reported in that time frame. We hope that highlighting them does not
diminish the **over 200** intersections in Los Angeles that have injured
at least 5 cyclists as reported in our data set. Keep in mind the number
of actual injuries is no doubt higher.

Similar to the [LA Times Analysis of Dangerous Pedestrian
Intersections](http://graphics.latimes.com/la-pedestrians/), we found
that 25% of cyclist injuries occurred at 1% of the intersections in Los
Angeles.

These intersections are prime candidates for improvement in line with
Los Angeles's [recently approved mobility
element](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-mobility-plan-los-angeles-20150811-story.html)
which lays out some new standards and strategies for how the city plans
and builds its transportation systems to facilitate **all** modes of
travel, not just automobiles. In particular, Garcetti's [vision
zero](http://la.streetsblog.org/2014/09/30/ladots-bold-new-strategic-vision-eliminate-l-a-traffic-deaths-by-2025/)
component declares that each traffic death must be viewed as a failure,
necessitating changes in infrastructure and/or policy, with a goal of
reducing traffic fatalities to zero by 2035.

We hope you found this analysis interesting, and maybe even useful. If you are

not hard to get started, and we're excited to share and learn with other folks
interested in using data to help draw conclusions of the world around us.
