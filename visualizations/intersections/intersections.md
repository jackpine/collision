L.A.'s Most Dangerous Intersections for Cyclists
================================================

We set out to find the most accident prone intersections for cyclists in
the city of Los Angeles. Specifically, we want to rank interesctions by
the number of cyclists reported injured in [our collision
dataset](#dataset).

Our high level results, although there were some concentrated areas of
especially dangerous intersections, significant hotspots are scatterd
across the entire city.

The List
--------

### Tenth Most Dangerous Intersection(s)

Sunset & La Brea, Raymer St & Sepulveda Blvd, and Lincoln Blvd & Lake
Street are in a threeway tie for the tenth most dangerous intersections
for cyclists in Los Angeles. There were ten cyclists injured at each of
these intersections in our [dataset](#dataset).

### Number Nine Through Six

An unenviable four-way tie for six through nine. James M Wood &
Vermont, 30th & University, Chandler & Lankershim,
Sherman Way & Remmet Ave all had cyclists reorted injured.

### Number Five

Hoover & 30th, near USC, comes in at the fifth most dangerous
intersection for cyclists in Los Angeles.  There were 12 injured
cyclists at this intersection recorded in our data set.

There were several high incident spots near USC. In fact, four of the
top 10 intersections with the most bicycle collisions occured near USC.
Part of this is no doubt related to the high number of cyclists in this
neighborhood, but it also speaks to the need for increased investment in
safe cycling infrastrucure.

### Tied for Number Three

Continuing our sad story of cycling near USC, 28th & Hoover and 29th &
Hoover were indendently tied for the number three most dangerous
intersection in LA. There were 13 recorded injuries in our
[dataset](#dataset) at *each* intersection. Also intereseting is that
both of these are "T" intersections, with streets terminating into
Hoover. Would you guess that it was people who were just turning onto
Hoover, or peole just about to turn off of Hoover?  It's hard to say,
but from the data it appears that at 28th & Hoover people have been hit
*on* Hoover, while on 29th & Hoover, people have been hit *on* 29th.

### Number Two

The number two most dangerous interesection for cyclists was Jefferson
& Vermont. 15 cyclists were injured here.

### Number One

With 16 recorded cyclist injuries in our [dataset](#dataset), the number
one most dangerous intersection for cyclists in Los Angeles is 4th &
Vermont, in Koreatown.

Another point of concern was along Vermont Avenue. Three of the top ten
spots were along Vermont, though at different points. This is a high
traffic street with no bicycle infrastructure.

This may point to the lack of strong North/South connector alternatives
for cyclists in Los Angeles. There is relatively more bike lanes on
major east west streets like Santa Monica Blvd (in West Hollywood) and
Sunset Blvd from Echo park to it's junction in East Hollywood, also 4th
and 7th streets across Koreatown boast bike lanes or sharrows. But
where are our major North/South bike lanes?

## Dataset

This analysis is based on the data pulled from the TIMS project out of
Berkeley which in turn gets their data from the California Highway
Patrol SWITRS database. It encomposses collisions reported to law
enforcement between 2002-2012.

This data is somewhat old. With cycling on the rise, the number of
people affected, and potentially at risk for injury or death while
cycling in the city is certainly growing. Take a look at our [heatmap of
bicyle collisions](http://collisions.jackpine.me) in Los Angeles to get
an idea of how bicycle collisions are growing over time.

## Conclusion

When analysing the data, it's clear that there are intersections with
inordinately high number of cyclist injuries. This is likely due to both
a higher volume of cyclists and a lack of adequate cycling
infrastructure in these neighborhoods.


In particular around USC and along the Vermont corridor are ripe for
better cycling infrastructure. But beyond these clusters, most dangerous
intersecions in Los Angeles are scattered. From Santa Monica to Boyle
Heights, from Canoga Park to the Harbor, it's clear that better
comprehensive planning and engineering is required across the city.

TODO:
Compare this to the results from the L.A. Times article documenting the
most dangerous intersections for pedestrians.

These are just the top 10 intersections, and we hope that highlighting
them does not diminish the **over 200** intersections in Los Angeles
that have injured at least 5 cyclists in our data set. Keep in mind the
number of actual injuries is no doubt higher when you consider
unreported incidents and the age of our data.  These intersections are
all prime candidates for improvement in line with Los Angeles's
[recently approved mobility element]() which lays out some new standards
and strategies how the city plans and builds its transportation systems
to facilitate **all** modes of travel, not just cars. In particular,
Garcetti's [vision zero]() component declares that each death must be
viewed as a failure, necesitating changes in infrastructure and or
policy.
